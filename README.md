# fileIO

Let this be temp:

* You probably know everything you need to know for this project

* Be sure to review file input streams and string streams

* Create all the variables you'll need. This will include a file pointer, at least one stringstream, and a number of strings and ints
*  Open up the data file
* use a loop to read the file one line at a time
* Use a stringstream and the getline() functionn to read on data element at a time
	* note that the delimiter is a char, not a string, so it should be in a single quote
	* note also that you may need temporary strings, because getline always returns strings
* use a stringstream to do any data conversion you might need
* add up the two integers
* print the text that number of times
* repeat for each line the text file.
